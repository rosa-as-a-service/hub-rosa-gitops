## Contributing

### Our workflow

Contributing to Hub ROSA GitOps should be as simple as possible. Have a question? Want
to discuss something? Want to contribute something? Just open an
[Issue](https://github.com/rosa-as-a-service/hub-rosa-gitops/issues), a [Pull
Request](https://github.com/rosa-as-a-service/hub-rosa-gitops/pulls).

If you spot a bug or want to change something pretty simple, just go
ahead and open an Issue and/or a Pull Request, including your changes
at [rosa-as-a-service/hub-rosa-gitops](https://github.com/rosa-as-a-service/hub-rosa-gitops).

For bigger changes, please create a tracker Issue, describing what you want to
do. Then either as the first commit in a Pull Request, or as an independent
Pull Request, provide an **informal** design proposal of your intended changes.
The location for such proposals is
[/docs](docs/) in the rosa-as-a-service
core repository. Make sure that all your Pull Requests link back to the
relevant Issues.

### Getting started

To make yourself comfortable with the code, you might want to work on some
Issues marked with one or more of the following labels:
[good-first-issue](https://github.com/rosa-as-a-service/hub-rosa-gitops/labels/good-first-issue),
[help wanted](https://github.com/rosa-as-a-service/hub-rosa-gitops/labels/help%20wanted)
or [kind/bug](https://github.com/rosa-as-a-service/hub-rosa-gitops/labels/kind%2Fbug).
Any help is highly appreciated.

### Testing

We use integration testing as the primary testing method.
A successful test is a successful deploy and followon configuration.

### Contributor compliance with Developer Certificate Of Origin (DCO)

We require every contributor to certify that they are legally permitted to contribute to our project.
A contributor expresses this by consciously signing their commits, and by this act expressing that
they comply with the [Developer Certificate Of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

A signed commit is a commit where the commit message contains the following content:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <jdoe@example.org>
```

This can be done by adding [`--signoff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) to your git command line.

### Getting your code reviewed/merged

Maintainers are here to help you enabling your use-case in a reasonable amount
of time. The maintainers will try to review your code and give you productive
feedback in a reasonable amount of time. However, if you are blocked on a
review, or your Pull Request does not get the attention you think it deserves,
reach out for us via Comments in your Issues.

Maintainers are tracked in [CODEOWNERS
files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).
